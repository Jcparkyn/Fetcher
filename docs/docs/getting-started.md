# Getting Started

You can install Phetch via the .NET CLI with the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package Phetch.Blazor
```

If you're using Visual Studio, you can also install via the built-in NuGet package manager.

Once you've installed it, the first thing you'll want to do is [define an endpoint](./defining-query-endpoints.md).
