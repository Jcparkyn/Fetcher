# Phetch

Phetch is a small Blazor library for handling async query state, in the style of [React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query), [SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr), or [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview).

Currently, Phetch is only designed for use with Blazor WebAssembly. However, the core package (Phetch.Core) has no dependencies on Blazor or ASP.NET Core, so in theory it can be used anywhere that supports .NET Standard 2.1.

| :information_source: Status: All core features are finished, but there may be some minor breaking changes before a v1.0.0 release. |
